"""AGENT-EDITABLE — model architecture + deployment inference wrapper.

The autoresearch loop may rewrite anything here (architecture, loss,
confidence mechanism, unified vs. dispatcher+specialists, pretrained init
per CLAUDE.md §3/§9) as long as:
  - train.py exports one ONNX per area at <out>/models/<area>.onnx taking a
    1x3x128x128 float32 input in [0,1] and returning [[u, v, conf]] with
    u, v normalized map coords and conf in [0,1];
  - the export passes pipeline/score.py's frozen deployment gates.

Current: localization as MAP-CELL CLASSIFICATION, from-scratch init, decoded by
LOCAL BELIEF POOLING. The map is cut into CELL_PX-square cells (Berlin:
55x54 = 2970); a conv trunk feeds a C-way softmax over cells plus a within-cell
offset head. The deployed decode pools belief over the 3x3 block of cells
centred on the argmax cell: confidence is the softmax mass on that whole
neighborhood, and the fix is the mass-weighted centroid of those cell centres,
nudged by the offset. Eval views stand 11-17 m off-lattice, so a view near a
cell border honestly splits its mass between adjacent cells — that is label
ambiguity, not place ambiguity, and pooling makes confidence measure "does the
model know WHERE it is" rather than "which arbitrary tile label applies".
Belief scattered across DISTANT cells still falls below threshold, so genuine
far-field ambiguity remains a safe abstention rather than a false fix. The
deployed decode additionally demands ROTATION CONSENSUS: the frame and its
90/180/270-degree rotations are run through the shared trunk as one batch and
their four belief distributions are AVERAGED before pooling. Training draws a
fresh uniform-random heading per position per epoch, so a genuinely memorized
place is heading-invariant by construction, while a false match to a look-alike
twin rides view-specific micro-texture that does not survive rotating the same
frame — its mass splits across distant blocks and drops below threshold, so a
confident wrong answer becomes an honest abstention. Cell
size is chosen so the parameterization alone suffices: a 128 m cell's
half-diagonal is 90.5 m, inside the 100 m usable radius, so naming the right
cell is already a usable fix. The TRAINING TARGETS are decode-consistent: the
cell target is a bilinear tent distribution over the <=4 nearest cell centres
(so a border view is taught the honest split its pooled decode will produce,
not an arbitrary one-cell label), and the offset target is the residual the
pooled centroid leaves rather than the position that centroid already encodes.

The whole decode (softmax -> argmax -> neighborhood mask -> pooled centroid ->
offset -> conf) lives INSIDE the exported graph, because the scorer runs the
ONNX directly.
