"""The research-evolution figure, generated from data instead of hand-placed.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
This figure used to be a 13.8 KB single-line SVG literal in gallery.py with
every coordinate baked in, plus an `evolution_fork_svg()` that did eight
find-and-replace edits on that string to lift the berlin-slim work onto its
own lane. Three lists (TRUNK, DEAD, SUPER) sat next to it looking like the
source of truth and were not: the literal had been hand-edited past them, so
SUPER held five entries while the figure drew six, and TRUNK held thirteen
while the figure drew nine.

The cost showed up the first time anything was added. Placing one small branch
took three attempts -- once outside the era band, once anchored to y=256, which
after the fork surgery is the DORMANT main line, so the new branch was drawn
descending from an abandoned trunk rather than from the champion that produced
it. Both were invisible in the markup and obvious in a screenshot. A figure
that cannot be reviewed by reading it is a figure that ships wrong.

So: the marks below are data, and this module lays them out. Adding a branch is
appending a tuple; moving it is changing its lane. The fork is part of layout
rather than surgery performed on the output.

THE TIME AXIS IS NOT LINEAR, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE
Each day gets width proportional to how much happened in it: the six silent
days of 24-29 July are 96 px each, while 22 and 31 July are ~1,000. The widths
were tuned by hand in the original figure and are preserved here verbatim
rather than re-derived, because they encode a judgement about what deserves
room -- not something to recompute. DAY_W is that judgement, written down.

Coordinates are recovered from the original figure to within 0.15 px, so this
regenerates it rather than redrawing it.
