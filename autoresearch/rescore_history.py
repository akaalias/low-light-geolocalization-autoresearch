"""Re-score every archived experiment on TODAY's ruler.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The project ran ~76 experiments across five eval/metric eras. Three of them
were scored against a broken evaluation (region holdout) and/or an error
statistic (median, then geometric mean) rather than the product requirement.
CLAUDE.md correctly voids those *verdicts*. But the work itself is real, and a
published progress chart that starts at experiment 1 of the current era makes
a two-week grind look like a four-experiment sprint.

This script does NOT "convert" old numbers with a fudge factor. It re-runs the
frozen, current `pipeline/score.py` against each old experiment's EXPORTED
`berlin.onnx` on the CURRENT eval set. Every point on the resulting chart is
therefore measured with the same ruler, because it literally is the same ruler.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT COMPARABLE
-----------------------------
Re-scored honestly means: same eval crops, same 100 m target, same 0.3
confidence threshold, same mission-score formula. It does NOT mean the old
models were *aiming* at this target — they were optimized against a different
metric on a different eval set, and eras 1-2 also trained on a region-holdout
split that excluded ~28% of the box, so they are being asked about ground they
were never shown. That is a real handicap and it is stated on the page rather
than corrected for: the point of the chart is "what would this model have been
worth to the aircraft", and the answer for a model that never saw a third of
the map is legitimately "not much".

RECOVERABILITY
--------------
  exact (rescored)  — an exported berlin.onnx still exists on disk
  exact (gated)     — the experiment failed a deployment gate or never trained;
                      it had no usable model then and has none now, so it plots
                      as a gated fail exactly as it always did
  derived           — pre-mission-metric era: the run dirs were deleted, but
                      that era's score.py logged `coverage` and
                      `hit_rate_at_target` over the confident subset, which
                      determines usable/false rates algebraically
  unrecoverable     — model gone and no rate data logged; plotted as a gap
