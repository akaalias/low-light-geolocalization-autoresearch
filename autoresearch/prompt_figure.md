# Draw the architecture figure — one narrow job

A separate design agent already decided this iteration's experiment, and
it has already been implemented, trained, and scored — the record is
final. Your ONLY job is to draw its technical architecture diagram for
the gallery. You do not evaluate, second-guess, or change the design;
just illustrate what it already is.

Read the finished experiment record (path given below this prompt) for
`title`, `hypothesis`, `method`, and `architecture.stages` — that is the
diagram's content. Write exactly one field to the output path given below:
```json
{"architecture_svg": "<svg viewBox='0 0 980 300' …>…</svg>"}
```

`architecture_svg` is the **technical architecture diagram** of the model
that was tested — a proper ML-paper figure of the design, shown at the
top of this experiment's gallery entry. **Draw tensors and operations as
the things they are — NOT as labeled boxes:** the input image as a
pixel-textured square; conv feature maps as pseudo-3D slabs that shrink
spatially and deepen in channels; 1-D vectors as thin vertical tick-bars;
fully-connected layers as fans of thin crossing lines between bars;
spatial fields/grids as actually-drawn grids with shaded cells;
decodes/aggregations as thin lines converging from cells onto a point;
samplers/targets as small pictorial glyphs. Captions sit UNDER each
element (name ≤10.5px weight 600, sub-note ≤9.5px); tensor shapes
annotate the flow in small italics (128×128×3 → 8²×128 → 1024).
Losses/targets/samplers live in a lane below the inference path,
annotated with slanted dashed leader lines to small text — no boxes
around them. Draw the two FROZEN endpoints — the camera-frame input and
the (lat, lon, confidence) output — entirely in #9b998c with a small
italic "frozen contract" tag: they are fixed by the harness and outside
the design's search space. Everything between them is the design: draw
it in ink, with red only on what THIS experiment changed (per
`architecture.stages[].changed`). Style contract, so all experiments'
figures read as one paper: viewBox width 980 (height ~300–360);
transparent background; ink #111111, captions #6b6a60,
annotations/arrows #9b998c; **#8c2f1f (red) reserved for exactly what
this experiment changed**; training-only elements in #8a6a1e (or red if
changed); font-family Palatino,Georgia,serif; stroke-width ≈1.2
elements, 1 arrows; fills only faint tints (opacity ≤ .12); no
gradients, no icons, no emoji. Inference flows left → right from camera
frame to (lat, lon, confidence).

**The camera frame is a fixed glyph — copy it verbatim.** It must look
like an actual nadir frame of terrain (streets, building footprints),
not abstract pixels, and be identical in every figure. Use exactly this
snippet, substituting Y for the frame's top edge (pick Y so the frame
centers on your inference lane; captions go under it as usual — note
128²×3 is the model input crop, ~1 m/px, not the sensor's native
resolution):
```svg

```
(Y+n means the literal number Y plus n — compute the values. Every glyph
element stays strictly INSIDE the frame border — figcheck rejects a
figure without the `cam-terrain` group.) Draw the receptive-field square
and kernel-projection lines on top of it as usual.

**Anchor the frozen endpoints identically in every figure** so all
experiments' figures line up when compared down the gallery page: the
camera-frame square starts at x=26 (its captions centered on x=53), and
the output is right-anchored — decode crosshair at x=812, the
(lat, lon, confidence) text block text-anchor=start at x=828. Mark the
anchors machine-checkably: the camera-frame rect carries
`id='frozen-input'`, the output text block carries `id='frozen-output'`.
Lay the elements between them out on a running x-cursor with generous
spacing so nothing overlaps.

**Readability contract** (figcheck verifies this geometrically): no
text may overlap other text, and no line (arrows, converge fans,
leader lines) may pass through a label — a line may END at a label,
never cross one. Rules distilled from review rounds: dashed leaders
run as orthogonal L-routes through empty lanes, never diagonally
across components; converge/vote lines originate at their true
sources (the actual dots or window cells, not generic positions);
every element owns its caption — adjacent columns stagger their
caption rows instead of colliding; prefer moving a label into empty
horizontal space over stacking it against a neighbor. Width is fixed
at 980, but **height is yours**: grow the viewBox (240–640) whenever
more vertical room makes the layout cleaner rather than cramming.

**Before finishing, validate:** `.venv/bin/python -m autoresearch.figcheck
<your output path>` — it checks the anchor contract; revise until it
prints PASS. Consecutive conv layers must be tied by kernel-projection
lines (small kernel square on one face, faint lines converging to a cell
on the next) so the encoder reads as one computation, not boxes in a
row. `archive/arch_svg_reference.py` is the concrete reference
implementation of this entire visual language — read it and reuse its
helper geometry for any stage that already has one.

## Hard rules

- Edit ONLY the output path given below. You never edit `model/`,
  `experiment.json`, or any file listed in `/FROZEN`.
- Do not re-evaluate the experiment, change its hypothesis, or query the
  lineage DB for anything beyond what's needed to draw the figure
  consistently with prior stage names.
